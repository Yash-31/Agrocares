        <div class="intro">
            <p>Introduction to soil preparation in agriculture. Soil is the backbone of agriculture. Therefore, it is
                important to know the soil before farming. Soil are different types; some are loamy and fertile while
                some
                are sandy and infertile. Not all types of soil are suitable for every crop. Crop grown in fertile soil
                will
                not necessarily yield, as soil quality preparation is esssential for better quality.</p>
            <p>The soil is prepared before sowing the seed. The soil is loose to increase water and fertilizer
                absorption.
                Loosening of soil particlesc adds humus and nutrients to the soil which increases crop yields. Soil
                anchors
                the roots of a plants to support its water supply, help it breathe, and provide the nutrients it needs
                to
                grow.</p>

            <h2 class="content-title">A step-by-step guide to soil preparation in agriculture, soil preparation methods,
                tips, ideas, and techniques</h2>
            <p>Agricultural soil is soil that is loamy and fertile and is considered because there can be different
                types of
                soil and
                there are many that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. The best soil can be called agricultural
                soil.
                As the
                backbone of agriculture, the soil should be best suited for growing different crops and producing better
                yields
                and better-quality plants.</p>
            <p>Soil preparation is the first step when we start farming. This usually forces the top layer of soil to
                loosen.
                Plants
                absorb water and nutrients from the soil through their roots, so it is important to prepare the soil so
                that we
                can get
                healthy and full yields. Soil is an important building for growing strong, healthy, and beautiful
                plants.
                Determine the
                soil before you choose it. Read the editing and potting mix labels carefully to make sure you have made
                the
                right choice
                for your plants. One month after planting, feed and water your plants properly.</p>
            <h3 class="title2">Tips to choose the best soil for your plants</h3>
            <p>Here are some ways you can choose the best soil for your plants;</p>
            <p>1. Depending on the plant – Depending on the plant the type of soil can be selected. For example, if you
                are
                planning
                to plant a vegetable garden, the soil you choose must be moist and loose, which will give the roots
                elasticity
                so that they can spread and
                grow and get maximum nutrients from the soil.</p>
            <p>2. According to the quality – Make sure you pay attention to the quality of the soil. Too much clay or
                sandy
                soil may not be ideal for
                plant growth. It is just the ideal soil mixture for better plant growth. Make sure you identify the soil
                in your
                garden and then change it according to the type of plant you want to grow.</p>
            <p>3. Soil composition – Soil is made up of decomposing rock particles, air, water, living organisms, and
                organic
                matter
                from decomposing plants and animals. Each of these components differs in quantity and properties, but
                all five
                are
                essential for healthy soil.</p>
            <p>4. Soil texture and type – Soil type is generally classified by the size of the broken-down rock
                particles in the
                soil. A large particle of sand is the size of a medium particle of dirt, and a particle of clay is very
                fine.
                The
                ratio of sand, soil, and soil particles determines the composition of your soil and affects the
                availability of
                drainage and nutrients.</p>
            <p>5. Soil water holding capacity – Sandy soils have large particles and the ability to hold very little
                water –
                water
                escapes through them quickly. Soil is capable of holding very fine particles and a lot of water. It is
                important
                to
                know this because it tells you how much and how often you will need to water your plants. Soil structure
                is
                determined by how individual soil particles accumulate. A good soil structure allows water, oxygen, and
                microorganisms to enter the soil and as a result, increase the number of nutrients available to plants.
                The
                structure can be greatly affected by management. Constantly adding compost to the soil will
                improve its texture, increase its water holding capacity and make it easier to operate in the long run.
            </p>
            <p>6. Soil testing – A professional soil test provides a
                wealth of information about your soil, including its type, pH level (relative acidity), and nutrient
                level. If
                you
                are starting a new garden and have concerns about potential soil toxins in your area, such as lead, a
                soil test
                that
                screens common environmental toxins are a good idea.</p>
            <p>7. Based on the place of planting – The selected soil for your plants will also depend on where you plan
                to grow
                the
                plants. For example, plants with large pots in your yard or large pots require more nutritious soil than
                plants
                planted in your lawn. Potting soil contains special ingredients that prevent water or excess water in
                the
                plants.
                Make sure you invest in good quality soil as sometimes cheap alternatives do not provide enough
                nutrients to the
                soil.</p>
            <p>8. Soil Preparation – Once you have narrowed down the soil to suit the needs of the plants, another
                important
                step in
                the process is to prepare the soil. You must determine the type of soil that is available so that you
                can make
                the
                necessary changes by adding organic matter and other additives to make it ideal for growing a variety of
                plants.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title2">Determining soil pH and soil type</h3>
            <p>Soil pH level reflects its acidity and is measured on a scale of 0 (most acidic) to 14 (mostly alkaline
                soils).
                Most
                plants grow best in soil pH levels 6 and 7. Before editing the soil, quickly test your native soil using
                a
                simple pH
                test kit. This will help you decide whether to increase the pH with lime or lower the sulfur. Depending
                on where
                you live,
                your
                soil may be sandy or overgrown. A “feel test” can identify the type of soil that is most prominent in
                your yard.
            </p>
            <p>Moisten a tablespoon of clay and roll it into a small ball. If you can make a 2-to-3-inch ribbon from the
                clay of
                your ball, then the clay content in your clay is very high. If the ribbon breaks or feels sharp, you
                have a
                mixture
                of dirt and sand. If the soil ball feels a little greasy and no matter how much water you add, don’t put
                it
                together, it’s sandy soil. In addition to lime-rich chalky soils, types such as clay soils, loamy soils,
                and wet
                soils are defined by their acidity and the ratio of sand, soil, and silt.</p>
